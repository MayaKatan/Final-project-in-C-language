# Final Project in C and Assembly Language üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **System Programming Laboratory** course during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science. The task was to design and implement an **assembler** in **C** for a specific assembly language, following precise guidelines. The project involved creating a tool to convert assembly language code into machine-readable code, allowing execution on a processor.

## Features
- **Assembler Implementation**: Developed an assembler to translate assembly language instructions into machine code.
- **Parsing**: Created parsers for assembly language syntax, ensuring correct parsing of opcodes, operands, and labels.
- **Error Handling**: Integrated error handling to catch invalid syntax and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
- **Optimization**: Applied optimization techniques for efficient memory and performance usage.
- **Testing**: Tested the assembler with multiple sample programs to ensure correctness and reliability of the implementation.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming**: The assembler was implemented in C, focusing on system-level programming and memory management.
- **Assembly Language**: The project worked with a custom assembly language, following a specific instruction set and syntax.
- **Makefile**: Utilized a Makefile for build automation to compile and run the assembler program.

## Project Goals
- To understand the relationship between high-level programming and low-level machine operations.
- To gain experience in writing compilers and interpreters, specifically focusing on assembly-to-machine translation.
- To apply theoretical concepts in practical systems programming tasks.

## Challenges
- Implementing accurate parsing logic for a low-level language.
- Managing memory efficiently while working with machine code.
